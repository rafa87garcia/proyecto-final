    <h1>About Puri Sport</h1>
    <p>Our mission is what drives us to do everything possible to expand human potential. We do that by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, by making our products more sustainably, by building a creative and diverse global team and by making a positive impact in communities where we live and work.</p>
    <h2>Innovation</h2>
    <p>The program's initial chapter, launching May 26 at The Grove in Los Angeles, features three iconic Medias Puri fleece hoodie and crew silhouettes. Each silhouette is available in limited quantities, and the individual pieces have been restored to a wearable condition through a manual process of cleaning, dyeing, stitching and patching. Each piece is unique and features patches, as well as decorative stitching to enhance durability, and a range of Nike heritage and LA-inspired screen-printed graphics. </p>
    <h2>For the Future</h2>
    <p>To protect the planet, we donâ€™t wait for solutions, we create them. In order to protect the future of sport, our Planet work is focused on carbon, waste, water and chemistry.</p>
